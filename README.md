# Basic CV written in HTML
This basic CV is an early project from my web development journey, which I created using only HTML. The project aimed to provide a simple and straightforward representation of my skills and work experience.
#### The HTML file contains a single page that includes several sections, such as:
* A header section: This section includes my name and a brief introduction to who I am and what I do.

* An education section: Here, I have listed my educational qualifications and achievements, including the degree or course name, the institution, and the year of completion.

* A skills section: This section highlights my technical and soft skills, such as programming languages, tools, and other abilities that are relevant to my career.

A footer section: This section includes my contact information, such as my email address, phone number, and social media profiles.
